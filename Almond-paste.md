# Homemade almond paste 
## Ingredents
200 g raw almonds, skin on  
200 g granulated sugar  
if necessary, a little cold water  
parchment paper and plastic wrap/airtight (plastic) bag
## Instructions  
Blanch almonds by putting them in a pot and pour (cold) water until all almonds are submerged.  
Bring to a boil and turn down to simmer. Let the almonds simmer until the skin visibly starts to wrinkle.
  
Strain the almonds, then peel them. Place the peeled almonds in a heat proof bowl (or pot).  
  
Boil some more water, enough to cover the peeled almonds. Pour the hot water over the almonds and soak them for about 20 mins (or until they soften a bit).  
  
Strain the almonds and place them together with the granulated sugar in a food processor. Mix them together until the mixture is smooth. You may need to add some water if the mixture looks dry and doesn't keep together.  
  
Turn the mixture out on parchment paper and roll into a log. Wrap the log with parchment paper, then wrap the paper-wrapped log with plastic wrap, alternatively place the log into a plastic bag to keep from drying too quickly.  
## Store  
The almond paste can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 weeks. It also freezes well.
