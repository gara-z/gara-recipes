    "text": "3.1.1 Ingredients\n1 tsp (5 ml) salt\n150 ml (2/3 cup / 5 1/2 oz) water, very cold\n455 g (1 lb / 3 cups + 2 Tbsp) all-purpose flour\n300 g (10 1/2 oz / 1 cup + 5 Tbsp) unsalted butter, very cold\n\n\n3.1.2 Directions\nMeasure up the flour in a bowl and put it into the freezer while you prepare the other ingredients. Add salt to a container filled with cold water and stir to dissolve the salt. Put the container into the fridge. Measure the butter and cut into cubes, approx 1-inch pieces. Put the butter into the freezer for approx 7 mins. If butter is still soft, leave it in for another couple of minutes. It should not be completely frozen and hard.\nWhen the butter has chilled, start making the dough. Transfer the water into the freezer and set a timer for 8 mins. While the water is being chilled, put the cold flour in a mixing bowl and scatter the butter over. Toss the butter with the flour and make sure the cubes are all covered with flour, then squish each cube flat.\nDrizzle the chilled water mixture over flour-butter mix, and stir and toss with a fork until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass. Press the dough mixture together to get it a little more cohesive but make sure not to knead it. You should be able to see butter chunks.\nTransfer dough mass onto a work surface, and shape into a small rectangular shape. Dust the rolling pin and roll out the dough rectangle with 2-3 rolls keeping a rectangular shape. With a bench scraper, scrape and fold the top, bottom, and sides together again to the original size. Place any loose pieces on top and reroll. Dust workspace lightly if needed. Repeat rolling and folding twice until the dough becomes more smooth and cohesive. Avoid to overwork the dough, it should appear marbled with butter.\nDivide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each piece into a disk, approx 1 inch thick. Cover dough in plastic wrap and chill well in the fridge for about 2 hours before rolling it out. The dough can be kept in the fridge overnight or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.\nRoll out appr 1/8 inch thick.\nBake at 375 F. If the tart/galette/pie is browning too quickly, reduce the oven to 350 F or place aluminium foil on top.\nLet cool on a wire rack.",

    "text": "3.2 II: Old-fashined flaky pie dough\n\n3.2.1 Ingredients\n1 tsp (5 ml / 4 g) Kosher salt\n1 Tbsp (15 g / 1/2 oz) sugar\n225 g (1 2/3 cups / 8 oz) all-purpose flour\n225 g (8 oz / 2 sticks) unsalted American butter, very cold\n115 g (1/2 cup) water, very cold\n\n\n3.2.2 Directions\nFor the Dough: Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes (this size is important, as smaller pieces will melt too fast) and toss with flour mixture to break up the pieces. With your fingertips, smash each cube flat—that’s it! No rubbing or cutting. Stir in water, then knead dough against the sides of the bowl until it comes together in a shaggy ball. Dough temperature should register between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C); if not, refrigerate briefly before rolling and folding.\nMake the Layers: On a generously floured work surface, roll dough into a roughly 10- by 15-inch rectangle. Fold the 10-inch sides to the center, then close the newly formed packet like a book. Fold in half once more, bringing the short sides together to create a thick block. Divide in half with a sharp knife or bench scraper. Dough temperature should still be somewhere between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C); if not, refrigerate briefly before proceeding.\nFor Single-Crusted Pies: Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch circle and drape across a 9-inch pie plate; it will be super easy to lift by hand. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into the very corners of the pan. With scissors or kitchen shears, trim the edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches all around. Fold overhang over itself to create a thick border that sits atop the rim of the pan. Crimp or shape crust as desired. Repeat with remaining dough. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Use as directed in your favorite recipe.\nFor a Double-Crusted Pie: Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch circle and drape across a 9-inch pie plate; it will be super easy to lift by hand. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into the very corners of the pan. With scissors or kitchen shears, trim the edge so that it overhangs by 1 inch all around. For a solid top crust, roll remaining dough as before, or roll into a 9- by 15-inch rectangle for a lattice-top pie. Transfer the entire sheet, uncut, to a baking sheet or parchment-lined cutting board. (The parchment will prevent dough from absorbing any savory odors from the board.) Wrap both portions in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Use as directed in your favorite recipe.\nFor a Blind-Baked Pie: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). Line chilled pie shell with a large sheet of aluminum foil, pressing so it conforms to the curves of the plate (a second sheet of aluminum may be needed for full coverage). Fill to the brim with sugar, transfer to a half sheet pan, and bake until fully set and golden around the edges, 60 to 75 minutes. Fold long sides of foil toward the middle, gather short sides, and use both hands to carefully transfer sugar to a heat-safe bowl. Let sugar cool to room temperature. If needed, continue baking crust a few minutes more to brown along the bottom.\nFor Lattice: Roll the remaining dough into a 9- by 15-inch rectangle. It’s the perfect size and shape to yield plenty of strips for a lattice-top pie, but it’s also big enough that you can cover the whole pie in one solid sheet, with enough extra dough for decorative cutouts, too. Before you can cut out the lattice strips, the dough needs to rest in the refrigerator, or the strips will shrink as the dough relaxes. Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet or cutting board so it can lie flat. Cover with plastic, and refrigerate at least two hours and up to 24; any longer and it’s better off frozen in carbonite. Refrigeration isn’t strictly about relaxing the gluten; it’s about chilling the butter to help preserve all those leafy sheets. The cold dough is also much easier to handle because it won’t smush or squish out of shape.\nLattice tutorial\nNotes\n\nSource: I: Flaky Tart Dough, Tartine (2006), Prueitt/Robertson\nRatios: 3:2:1, flour:butter:water\nII: Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough Recipe, Serious Eats, Stella Parks\nRatios: 2:2:1, flour:butter:water (1:1:0.5)\nFor consistent results, use a scale and weigh the ingredients.\nWhen room temperature exceeds 74°F, kitchen equipment and pantry staples will act as a heat source to the butter, creating a sticky dough. If it’s warm in your kitchen, you can manage dough temperature by: refrigerating ingredients and utensils, cut the butter in chunkier pieces, chill the workspace countertop with bags filled with ice and water, know the dough and its temperature (aim to keep it at 65°F (18°C).\nOld-Fashioned Flaky dough made with European butter becomes quite soft and therefore needs to rest in the fridge for quite a bit longer time than the recipe states. Add at least another 30 minutes.\nEuropean vs American butter: the European butter has higher fat content than the American.",

I’d recommend checking the cakes earlier, at 23-24 minutes if your oven tends to cook fast or if you’re using a convection oven.\nYou can also use two 9-inch cake pans for a two-layer cake (the layers will be thicker) instead of three 8-inch pans. Bake them for approximately 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. It also works very well with two 9.5-inch cake pans. Bake them for apporximately 30 minutes.\nFor at better incorporated frosting, mix the vegan butter with the powdered sugar first until well combined, and butter has softenend a bit, before adding the remaining ingredients.\nMake sure your cake is 100% cool before frosting.

    "text": "8.1.1 Dough (yields approx 24 rolls):\n150 g unsalted butter at roomtemperature\n2 tsp dry yeast\n500 g whole milk (alternatively, 400 g whole milk + 100 g heavy cream)\n1 egg at roomtemperature\n125 g granulated sugar\n1-2 tsp coarsely ground cardamom (from whole seeds) (optional)\n1 tsp kosher salt, alernatively 1/2 tsp regular salt\n850 g bread flour\n### Filling:\n150 g unsalted butter at roomtemperature\n1 Tbsp golden syrup\n1 tsp cornstarch\n2 Tbsp ground cinnamon\n40-50 g almond paste (optional)\n### Egg wash:\n1 egg splash of heavy cream or whole milk pinch of salt\n## Instructions:\nThis schedule describes mixing the dough in the evening, proofing the rolls in the fridge overnight, and baking them the next day.\nDough:\n1. Grind the cardamom seeds about the size of coarsely ground black pepper, e.g. using a mortar and pestle.\nFollow the instructions on the yeast package to activate it.\nSlightly warm the milk (alt. milk + cream) just enough to take the cold from the fridge off (but not warm to the touch) and put aside.\nMethod I, without preferment:\nCombine approx ⅔ of the flour with the remaining dry ingredients.\nPour the milk mixture into a bowl of a stand mixer and add the activated yeast.\nAdd the the egg and then the flour mixture, and mix on low speed. Add the butter piece by peice (tablespoon-sized) while the mixer is running; wait until the butter is incorporated into the dough before adding the next piece. When all the butter looks incorporated into the mixture, add the remaining flour.\nWhen the mixture has come together into an even mass, increase the speed until medium and mix for another few minutes. The dough should start coming clean away from the sides of the bowl, look glossy, and feel elastic when it’s ready. This will take approx 10 mins in total.\nMethod II, with preferment:\nCombine approx ⅔ of the flour with the milk and activated yeast into a mixin gbowl to make the preferment.\nMix on low speed until the dough comes together smoothly but no elasticity developed, about 5-7 mins.\nLet the preferment rest about 45-60 mins. Once rested, add the remaining ingredients to the dough and mix on low speed first, then increase to medium. The dough should start coming clean away from the sides of the bowl, look glossy, and feel elastic when it’s ready.\n1. Transfer the dough onto a slightly floured surface and fold it into a package. (If you mixed the dough by hand, don’t worry too much if the dough isn’t completely smooth, it’ll improve after the first rest).\nPut the package back into the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for approx 1 - 1 1/2 hours at room temperature.\n\nRight before the dough has completed resting, make the filling. The butter needs to be soft to easily spread out without tearing the dough. Mix the sugar with the syrup and then add with cinnamon and cornstartch together to the softened butter; mix to a smooth paste and set aside.\nTransfer dough onto a floured surface and flatten it out a little with your hands. Roll out the dough with a pin into a rectangle approx 600 x 40 mm. Make sure to sprinkle the working surface with flour to avoid the dough sticking to it.\nSpread the filling onto the dough as evenly as possible and all the way out to the edges.\nFold the dough twice into three equal layers of dough (like folding a business letter or making a croissant plaque): with the long side of the rectangle facing you, fold one third of the dough from the long side over onto the adjacent (second) third, then fold the last third part from the opposite side over onto the two layers. Roll out the folded dough a little bit; slightly and evenly with the pin.\nCut the dough into strips, each about 70 grams. Weigh the first few ones to get an idea of how big the pieces need to be. A plastic scraper works well for cutting to avoid marks on the working surface.\nTwist a strip of dough and twirl it around your index and middle fingers into a knotted roll. Add the rolls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for the final rise. Leave some space between them.\nSpray the rolls lightly with water and cover the sheet with plastic wrap (or just a towel) and let the rolls rest between 1 - 1 1/2 hours at room temperature.\nThe proofing should have started before the rolls are placed into the fridge for ovenght proofing. Cover the baking sheets with towels and place in the fridge for 8-10 hours.\nNext morning, take out the sheets from the fridge. Let the rolls prove at room temperature between approx 1 1/2 - 4 hours, depending on how much they proofed in the fridge and the room temperature.\nWhile the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 425 F at least 30 minutes before baking and prepare the egg wash. Whisk the egg, cream and salt until smooth and a bit runny texture.\nTo know when the rools are ready to bake, they should feel notably puffy when poked.\nLightly and carefully brush the egg wash onto the rolls. Sprinkle with pearlsugar.\nPlace one sheet at the time into the oven (middle) and bake until deep golden brown color on top and bottom, approx 13 minutes. If they start getting color quickly, cover with a piece of aluminum foil until fully baked. Make sure to look after them close to the end of the baking as they can turn dark brown or burn really fast once they start getting some color.\nRemove the buns from the oven and place them on a wire rack to cool. Cover with a kitchen towel while cooling.\nWhen buns have cooled, transfer them into a paper bag and then a plastix zip lock bag to avoid the rolls drying too quickly.",

    "text": "9.2 Passion fruit curd:\n\n9.2.1 Ingredients\n135 g granulated sugar\n6 egg yolks (from large eggs)\n150 ml juice from passion fruit (fresh or frozen)\n25 g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n\n\n9.2.2 Instructions\nPrepare a pot with water just enough that when placing a heatproof bowl on top, the bowl is not in contact with the water. Bring the water to a boil. Optional: Prepare another bowl with a fine-mesh strainer.\nCombine the sugar, yolks, and fruit juice in the heatproof bowl. Lower the heat of the stove so the water isn’t rumbling and place the bowl over the pot. Double-check that the bowl isn’t in contact with the boiling water.\nWhisk the mixture constantly to prevent the eggs to clot. It will take a while before the mixture starts to thicken, but once it does it can go fast.\nOnce the mixture has thickened enough that the whisk leaves traces in the mixture, remove the bowl from the pot.\nStir in the butter, piece by piece, and keep stirring unil the butter has melted and is fully incorporated.\nOptional: Once the butter has been incorporated into the curd, pour it trough the fine-mesh strainer to remove any pieces of coagulated egg yolk. If the mesh is very fine, you may have to press with a spatula to help the curd through the strainer.\nCover the curd with plastic wrap and make sure to place the wrap on the surface of the curd to prevent a thick skin forming. Alternatively, pour the curd into a piping bag if you’d like to pipe it on top of the pannacotta. Place the curd into the fridge to set and chill.",

    "section": "9.4 Notes",
    "text": "9.4 Notes\nPassion fruit juice: Frozen passion fruit juice can be found in bigger grocery stores or in Mexican/Latin American grocery stores (I used frozen found at Mi Terra, San Pablo Ave, Berkeley, which has quite tart but strong flavor). If using fresh passion fruit, one fruit yields about 2 Tbsp inlcuding seeds and about 1 Tbsp strained juice.\nAgar agar: I used the Telephone brand agar agar powder, found in the Asian food aisle in the grocery store. I boiled the pannacotta mixture for exactly 4 minutes (from the first boil until removing it from the heat), poured about 100 ml serving size and let it set for approx 24 hours in the fridge: the pannacotta was still a bit runny in the middle. Maybe let boil for approx 4.5-5 mins total to have it set all through.\nWhite chocolate: Use high-quality chocolate for this. I used the Divine and Lindt brands found in the grocery store; Divine was superior in creaminess and flavor but probably not the superior quality out there. These were also very sweet. Brands to try: Valrhona, Cacao Barry, Green & Black’s.\nRecipes adopted from Camilla Hamid, and Brinken bakar.",
