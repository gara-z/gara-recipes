# Flaky tart dough (2 9- or 10-inch tarts or pie shells)

### Ingredients  
1 tsp (5 ml) salt  
150 ml (2/3 cup / 5 1/2 oz) water, very cold  
455 g (1 lb / 3 cups + 2 Tbsp) all-purpose flour  
300 g (10 1/2 oz / 1 cup + 5 Tbsp) unsalted butter, very cold  

### Directions  
Measure up the flour in a bowl and put it into the freezer while you prepare the other ingredients.
Add salt to a container filled with cold water and stir to dissolve the salt. Put the container into the fridge.
Measure the butter and cut into cubes, approx 1-inch pieces. Put the butter into the freezer for approx 7-10 mins. 
Check in on the butter after 7 mins and if still soft, leave it in for another couple of minutes. It should not be completely 
frozen and hard.

When the butter has cooled off, start making the dough. Transfer the water into the freezer and set a timer for 8 mins. Put the
cold flour in a mixing bowl and scatter the butter over the flour. Cut the butter into the flour until the mixtuyre forms large
crumbs and some of the butter is still in pieces the size of peas. Drizzle the the water mixture over and stir and toss with a 
fork until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass. Gently mix until the dough comes together into a ball but is not completely
smooth. You should be able to see some butter chunks.

On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough into 2 equal balls and shape each ball into a disk 1 inch thick. Wrap well in
plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. The dough can be kept in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.

Roll out appr 1/8 inch thick.

Bake at 375 F. If the tart/galette/pie is browning too quickly, reduce the oven to 350 F or place aluminium foli on top.

Let cool at a wire rack.
