# Paleo Chocolate Cake

CAKE DRY INGREDIENTS  
3 cups almond flour  
1 cup tapioca flour  
1/4 cup coconut flour  
2 cups coconut sugar  
1 1/2 cups raw cacao powder  
2 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp espresso powder  
1 tsp salt  

CAKE WET INGREDIENTS  
4 large eggs  
1 1/2 cup full-fat coconut milk  
1 cup water  
1/2 cup coconut oil  
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
2 tsp vanilla extract  

CHOCOLATE FROSTING  
8 cups organic powdered sugar (or powdered coconut sugar, powdered succanat, etc)  
1 cup raw cacao powder  
1 cup organic palm shortening (or vegan butter or a combination of both)  
1/2-3/4 cup almond milk, cashew milk or coconut milk  
2 tsp vanilla extract  

DIRECTIONS, CAKE  
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.  
1. Grease three 8-inch cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper. I prefer to grease my pans with ghee or organic palm shortening as coconut oil can leave a slight coconut taste. Set these aside.  
1. Add all of the dry ingredients to a very large mixing bowl and whisk together.  
1. Add all of the wet ingredients to a separate medium mixing bowl and whisk together. Then, pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk together for 1-2 minutes to create your cake batter.  
1. Evenly divide the batter between the three baking pans and cook for 28-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.  
1. Once the cake has completely cooled, assemble the cake by adding the chocolate buttercream frosting between each layer and frosting the outside.  

DIRECTIONS, FROSTING  
1. Add all ingredients to a stand mixer and blend on low for 30 seconds. Once the ingredients have started to combine, slowly increase the speed to high and blend for one minute.  
1. To thin the consistency (if needed) add more milk, or to thicken add more powdered sugar.  

## Notes
My baking time of 28-30 minutes is based on a standard oven. I’d recommend checking the cakes earlier, at 23-24 minutes if your oven tends to cook fast or if you’re using a convection oven.
You can also use two 9-inch cake pans for a two-layer cake (the layers will be thicker). Bake them for approximately 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Remember to make sure your cake is 100% cool before frosting. Even the slightest amount of internal heat in the layers will cause the frosting to melt.
