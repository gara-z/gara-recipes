# Granola:

2 cups rolled oats, old-fashioned style  
2 cups rye flakes  
1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp flaxseeds  
1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp oat bran  
1/2 + 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds  
1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp desiccated coconut  
1 tsp salt  
1/2 + 1/3 cup nuts, cut into pieces  
1/3 cup + 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp honey, runny  
2 Tbsp + 2 tsp canola oil  
1/2 + 1/3 cup apple juice  

### Optional mix-in
200 g dried fruit or berries. Add to mixture above after it has been roasted and cooled.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F (175 C) and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mix the honey together with the liquids.
3. Pour the liquid mixture over the dry ingredients. Toss and mix together until everything is coated. 
4. Spread the mixture in an even layer onto the prepared pan. Bake until golden, for about 25 mins. Stir the mixture every 5-7 mins the first couple of times, then stir more frequently as the mixture gets more color.
5. Transfer mixture and parchment paper onto a cooling rack and let cool completely. Once cooled, mix in dried fruit or berries (optional). Store the granola in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.


## Notes

Use freshly pressed apple juice for best flavor.  
Almonds: cut into halves, or three pieces if on the bigger side (approx 2 cm).  
Hazelnuts (Filberts): cut into halves, or three pieces if on the bigger side.  
Pecan halves: cut into halves.  
Walnut halves: cut into quarters.  
Exchanging canola oil to coconut oil may require adjusted ratio of other ingredients.

2018-01-30: Used coconut oil instead of canola oil, and the apple juice flavor didn't come through as promintent as I remember from previous attempts. Could be that the coconut oil takes over and supresses the juice flavor.
