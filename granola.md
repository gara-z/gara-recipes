# Granola:

2 cups rolled oats, old-fashioned style  
2 cups rye flakes  
65 g flaxseeds  
120 g pumpkin seeds  
35 g coconut flakes  
1 tsp salt  
60 g raw almonds  
50 g raw hazelnuts  
30 g raw pecan halves  
85 g honey, runny  
2 Tbsp + 2 tsp canola oil, or other neutral plant oil   
200 g (200 ml) apple juice  

### Optional mix-in
200 g dried fruit or berries. Add to mixture above after it has been roasted and cooled.

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 320-350 F (160-175 C) and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Cut the nuts into pieces.  
2. Combine all dry ingredients except the coconut flakes in a large mixing bowl. Mix the honey together with the liquids.
3. Pour the liquid mixture over the dry ingredients. Toss and mix together until everything is coated. 
4. Spread the mixture in an even layer onto the prepared pan. Bake until golden, for about 30-45 mins or until mixture reaches desired color. Stir the mixture every 7 mins the first couple of times, then stir more frequently as the mixture gets more color.
5. Transfer mixture and parchment paper onto a cooling rack and let cool completely. 
6. Spread out the coconut flakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and toast at a lower temperature, approx 300 F, for a few minutes. Keep a close eye because the coconut burns quickly.  
7. Transfer the coconut and parchment paper onto a cooling rack and let cool completely.  
8. Once everything is cooled, mix the coconut flakes with the other mixture. If using dried fruit or berries, mix them in as well (optional). Store the granola in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.  


## Notes

Adopted from [Tasteline-Lyxmusli](http://www.tasteline.com/recept/lyxmusli/)  
Use freshly pressed apple juice for best flavor.  
Almonds: cut into halves, or three pieces if on the bigger side (approx 2 cm).  
Hazelnuts (Filberts): cut into halves, or three pieces if on the bigger side.  
Pecan halves: cut into quarters.  
Walnut halves: cut into quarters.  
Exchanging canola oil to coconut oil may require adjusted ratio of other ingredients.

2018-01-30: Used coconut oil instead of canola oil, and the apple juice flavor didn't come through as promintent as I remember from previous attempts. Could be that the coconut oil takes over and supresses the juice flavor. Use unrefined coconut oil which is odorless and flavorless.
