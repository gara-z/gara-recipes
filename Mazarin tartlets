## Notes  
Recipe adopted from Hilda Kirkoff and KÃ¶ket, https://www.koket.se/a-ppelmazariner-med-vaniljmascarpone  

In lieu of tartled tins, use a 12-cup muffin pan with the following adjustments:  
- cut out parchment paper into strips (approx 15 x 1 cm/6 x 0.5 inches), and place them cross-wise
into each cup before lining it with the dough; this will make it easier to unmold the pastries from the pan once they have
cooled off  
- 30 g dough to line each cup
