## 4 pizzas  
8 g (1 1/2 tsp) dry active yeast  
400 g (400 ml) cold water  
25 g (2 Tbsp) olive oil  
600 g () bread flour  
8 g (2 tsp) granulated sugar  
12 g (2 tsp) salt 
  
Prepare the dry active yeast according to instuctions on the package. Mix all ingredients together in a mixing boxl until they  
all come togetherproperly, no need to knead the dough. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest in room temperature for about  
45 minutes.  
  
Scrape the dough out on a floured work bench and cut into four pieces (or more for smaller pizzas). Shape each piece to a ball  
by tucking the edges in towards the middle to get tension on the surface.  
  
Put the balls onto a tray (or a larger plate). Pour a couple of drops of olive oil onto each ball and spread out the oil so the  
surfac of the balls is covered with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and put the tray into the fridge and let the balls proof  
for 8-24 hours (up to 48 hours should work).  
  
Preheat the oven to 480 F, or the highest temperature, for at least 30 minutes before baking the pizzas. Prepare toppings.  
  
Prepare one dough ball at the time; stretch or roll out the dough, cover with toppings (tomator sauce, cheese, toppings), and  
bake one pizza at the time for approx 5-10 mins. Let cool on a cooling rack until ready to eat.
