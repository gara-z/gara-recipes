1 Tbsp golden syrup

### Egg wash:  
1 egg

## Instructions:  
This schedule describes mixing the dough in the evening, proofing the rolls in the fridge overnight, and baking them the next day.  
  
Dough:  
1.  Grind the cardamom seeds about the size of coarsely ground black pepper, e.g. using a mortar and pestle.  
Follow the instructions on the yeast package to activate it.  
Slightly warm the milk (alt. milk + cream) just enough to take the cold from the fridge off (but not warm to the touch) and put aside.  
**Method I, without preferment:**  
- Combine approx ⅔ of the flour with the remaining dry ingredients.  
- Pour the milk mixture into a bowl of a stand mixer and add the activated yeast.  
- Add the the egg and then the flour mixture, and mix on low speed. Add the butter piece by piece (tablespoon-sized) while the mixer is running; wait until the butter is incorporated into the dough before adding the next piece. When all the butter looks incorporated into the mixture, add the remaining flour.  
- When the mixture has come together into an even mass, increase the speed until medium and mix for another few minutes. The dough should start coming clean away from the sides of the bowl, look glossy, and feel elastic when it's ready. This will take approx 10 mins in total.  
**Method II, with preferment:**  
- Combine approx ⅔ of the flour with the milk and activated yeast into a mixing bowl to make the preferment.  
- Mix on low speed until the dough comes together smoothly but no elasticity needed to develop, about 5-7 mins.  
- Let the preferment rest about 45-60 mins.
- Once preferment has increased in volume, add the egg and the butter piece by piece to the preferment and mix them together. Then add the remaining ingredients. Mix on low speed first, then increase to medium. The dough should start coming clean away from the sides of the bowl, look glossy, and feel elastic when it's ready (approx 10 mins).  
1. Transfer the dough onto a slightly floured surface and fold it into a package. (If you mixed the dough by hand, don’t worry too much if the dough isn’t completely smooth, it’ll improve after the first rest).  
Put the package back into the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for approx 2-5 hours at room temperature, or put into the fridge overnight for approx 10 hours. If the bulk proofing is at room temperature at this point, the final proofing of the shaped rolls can be done in the fridge over night for approx 8 hours.  
  
1. Right before the dough has completed resting and proofing, make the filling. The butter needs to be soft to easily spread out without tearing the dough.  
Mix the sugar with the syrup and then add with cinnamon and cornstartch together to the softened butter; mix to a smooth paste and set aside.  

1. If dough has been resting in the fridge, allow 30 mins-1 hour to warm up in room temperature first.  
Transfer dough onto a floured surface and flatten it out a little with your hands.   
Roll out the dough with a pin into a rectangle approx 600 x 40 mm. Make sure to sprinkle the working surface with flour to avoid the dough sticking to it.  
Spread the filling onto the dough as evenly as possible and all the way out to the edges.  

1. Fold the dough twice into three equal layers of dough (like folding a business letter or making a croissant plaque): with the long side of the rectangle facing you, fold one third of the dough from the long side over onto the adjacent (second) third, then fold the last third part from the opposite side over onto the two layers.  
Roll out the folded dough a little bit; slightly and evenly with the pin.

1. Cut the dough into strips, each about 70 grams. Weigh the first few ones to get an idea of how big the pieces need to be. A plastic scraper works well for cutting to avoid marks on the working surface.  
Twist a strip of dough and twirl it around your index and middle fingers into a knotted roll. Add the rolls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for the final rise. Leave some space between them.  
Spray the rolls lightly with water and cover the sheet with plastic wrap (or just a towel) and let the rolls rest and proof unitl doubled in size, approx 2-3 hours, even up to 4 hours, at room temperature. The proofing time depends on the room temperature; 20C/68F temp may require up to 4 hours proofing time. The rolls should be notably puffed but with some spring left at touch (this may require a few iterations to figure out what works best at your house and with your oven).  
Optional for room-temp bulk proofed dough: The proofing of the shaped rolls should have started before the rolls are placed into the fridge for overnight proofing. Cover the baking sheets with towels and place in the fridge for 8-10 hours.  

1. For final proof in fridge: Take out the sheets from the fridge. Let the rolls proof at room temperature between approx 1 1/2 - 3 hours, depending on how much they proofed in the fridge and the room temperature.  
Preheat the oven to 425 F at least 40 minutes before baking and prepare the egg wash.  
Whisk the egg, cream and salt until smooth and a bit runny texture.  
 
1. To know when the rools are ready to bake, they should feel notably puffy when poked.  
Lightly and carefully brush the egg wash onto the rolls. Sprinkle with pearlsugar.    
Place one sheet at the time into the oven (middle) and bake until deep golden brown color on top and bottom, approx 10-13 minutes. If they start getting color quickly, cover with a piece of aluminum foil until fully baked. Make sure to look after them close to the end of the baking as they can turn dark brown or burn really fast once they start getting some color.  
  
1. Remove the buns from the oven and place them on a wire rack to cool. Cover with a kitchen towel while cooling.  
When buns have cooled, transfer them into a paper bag and then a plastic zip lock bag to avoid the rolls drying too quickly.  
  
  
## Notes:
This recipe uses a smaller amount of yeast, which require long proofing times.  
Use whole cardamom seeds and grind them in a mortar (or electric mill) just before use. This gives the freshest fragrance and flavor.  
Freeze buns that will not be eaten the same day. They hold about one day in room temperature before starting to become dry.
